# Shield Singleplayer
Shield Singleplayer is a _attempt_ at making a Fortnite Singleplayer DLL for 3.5, it's very basic so no Gameplay abilities or Inventory. But I do plan on adding them in the future along with another project which will be more advanced for 3.5 or 4.1<br><br>

Oh and no SDK is included. Download the Raider 3.5 SDK from it's github repo and it should work
